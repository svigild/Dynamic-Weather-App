# ☀️ Dynamic-Weather-App

HTML/CSS/JavaScript Weather App done thanks to an API that sends the weather information. This is my first API app, was kinda difficult to understand everything but finally it was good. For the weather I used the OpenWeatherMap API and for the dynamic pictures I used Unsplash. Here are some examples, hope you like it :)
